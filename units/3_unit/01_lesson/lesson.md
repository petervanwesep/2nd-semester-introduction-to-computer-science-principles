# Lesson 3.01: Built-In Functions

##Learning Objectives
Students will be able to...
* Define and identify: **function, arguments, calling, importing, returning**
* Call the built-in `randint` function, using arguments
* Utilize code other people have written in the Python documentation
* Understand the difference between printing and returning

##Materials/Preparation
* [Do Now]
* [Lab - Magic 8-Ball]
* Associated Reading - section 3.1 of Book
* Read through the do now, lesson, and lab so that you are familiar with the requirements and can assist students.

## Instructor's Notes
1. **Do Now**
    * Give students 3-4 minutes to follow the instructions on the Do Now page.
    * Debrief the answers to the questions on the Do Now by calling on students to respond.
2. **Lesson**
    * Build Your Own Blocks vs Functions
 	    * Ask students to recall how they built custom blocks in Snap! ![Snap Custom Block](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Bbl2fh3igQ4/maxresdefault.jpg)
 	    * **Function**:  a named sequence of statements. You can use functions to perform complex calculations, graphical operations, and various other purposes. When you define a function, you specify the name and the sequence of statements. Later, you can "**call**" the function by name.
        * In SNAP! functions are blocks
        * A function definition is like a contract: you tell the programmer what elements the function expects (name and type of arguments) and the function will perform its purpose. It is good practice to use a comment to specify the purpose and contract of a function, including the type of value it returns, if it returns a value
        * Explain that we have already gotten used to **calling** functions like `type()` and `print()`.
    * Ask students how they would create a random number generator.
        * Sounds hard! Luckily someone has already done that: the random library (essentially a bunch of code written by someone else) which has many associated functions.
            * Random in Snap ![Random in Snap](http://bjc.berkeley.edu/bjc-r/img/lab-10/random-tree-buggy-code-snap.png)
        * Remind students what they saw in the Do Now - how to get a random integer: randint(0, 10).
            * Identify the 0 and 10 in this example as **arguments**, or values passed into the function.
  		    * Ask students what the argument is when we use `print` or `type`
  		    * `randint` gives back a value that you might want to store - this is called **returning**. If nothing is given back, the return value is `None`.
    * Contract
        * Functions have a contract: you write down the arguments, their type, and the return type expected.
            * Ask students what the contract of `randint` is.
                * 2 values, of type integer, with an integer returned
            * Since `randint` is written by someone else there is a place where that contract is written out - **Documentation**. Have students begin the lab, which will instruct them to find the Python documentation for the random library.

3. **Lab**
    * Students look through `random` library documentation, practice importing different random functions and using them.
    * Create a Magic 8-ball program using a list and `randint`.

4. **Debrief**
    * Check student progress and completion of the lab, wrap up by taking any final questions.

###Accommodation/Differentiation
If students are moving quickly, find another library to import from (see **bonus** in the lab) OR allow students to move on to creating their own functions.
