# Lab 5.02: EarSketch Music


1.	Beat strings are made up of combinations of three different characters. Explain the rhythmic meaning of each of the characters:
    * "0"
    * "+"
    * "-"
2. Create a new EarSketch project using the following requirements. Include your name and a project description at the top of the file.
    * This project should have 4 tracks and be 12 measures in length. Each track should use a different/unique audio sample.
    * Create 4 variables that hold audio loop constants.
    * Create 1 variable that holds a beat string.
    * On one track, use the makeBeat() function with your beat string. Your beat string rhythm should repeat for all 12 measures of the project.
    * Use the `setEffect()` function for at least one track.
    * Make sure to use comments that outline and describe your code.
